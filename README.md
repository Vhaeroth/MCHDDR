# MCHDDR
FFXIV Triggernometry triggers that give MCH a DDR-like combo meter.

Throw all the files in this location:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Advanced Combat Tracker\MCHDDR"

Then add the triggers in triggernometery.

I don't work on this activly so it may be buggy, but it seems to be pretty smooth latly.

You are free to change it if you like.
